# DWT-Mamba
A spatially-aware deep learning architecture designed for robust medical image classification through the integration of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and selective state space modeling (Mamba).

The source code for the proposed framework will be released upon acceptance of the manuscript to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

We thank the authors of MedMamba for their open-source codes.
